This has been a great series so far.  I have some experience working with Node.js, Express, and Angular.js and it has to be said that Brad's teach approach is wonderful.  The explaination on Node and Express's routing is succient and will be great for new comers.  

Updates to the this readme will follow after I get to the parts covering React and Redux.
